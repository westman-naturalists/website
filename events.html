<p><span class="event-title">Sparrow ID with Tim Poole</span>; Hosted by Westman Naturalists</p>
<p>The Manitoba Breeding Bird Atlas documented 22 species of New World Sparrow breeding in Manitoba. Some will remain in southern Manitoba to breed and some will move further afield to the boreal or the north. Join Tim Poole and the Westman Naturalists as we look through each species in turn, learn about its ecology, where to find it, and the tricks on how to identify each one in the field.</p>
<p>Tim Poole was born and raised in London, UK and studied Zoology at Cardiff University. Following completion of his Masters at the University of Leeds he spent 18 months in the south of France working on European Roller conservation and research and 6 years coordinating the Scottish recovery program for the Eurasian Capercaillie. He moved to Manitoba with his family in 2014 and coordinated the Important Bird Area Program and Manitoba Chimney Swift Initiative from 2015 and 2019. Since September 2019 Tim has worked for the Wildlife Branch at the Province of Manitoba as a Species at Risk Biologist focusing on Manitoba’s bird populations.</p>
<p>This is a hybrid event! Tim will be joining us via Zoom, but we’ll still be meeting in person! Feel free to come in person to socialize with your fellow Westman Naturalists and see the talk, or join us via Zoom.

<p><span class="event-title">Can birds smell? Evidence for odour-based communication in birds</span>; Hosted by Westman Naturalists</p>
<p>Can birds use smell to communicate and to evaluate potential mates? In this talk, Dr.&nbsp;Grieves will give a brief background on the possible origins of the myth that birds do not smell. Next, they will demonstrate the kinds of information that are available in bird body odour, using the humble Song Sparrow as a model. Finally, Leanne will share the results of some of their behavioural experiments performed to test whether birds use odour to make choices about the kinds of birds they want to hang around—and potentially mate—with.</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Leanne Grieves (pronouns: they/them or she/her) is a biologist specializing in animal behaviour and communication. Originally from Manitoba, Leanne is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at McMaster University, focusing on understanding the factors that affect bird body odour and how smell affects birds’ social and reproductive behaviour.</p>
<p>This is a hybrid event! Leanne will be joining us via Zoom, but we’ll still be meeting in person!

<p><strong>What is river Piracy?</strong> River piracy, also known as river capture, is an event where a river is diverted from its original channel into a neighbouring river. There are lots of different processes that can result in river piracy including erosion, damming by glacial ice or landslides, glacial retreat, or tectonic movement. The Souris River begins in Saskatchewan and flows southeast into south North Dakota and loops back into Manitoba. Approximately 20 km southeast of Wawanesa the Souris River takes a sharp 90 degree turn and joins the Assiniboine River east of Brandon. It wasn’t always like this as the Souris used to continue to flow southeast in the Pembina Valley back into North Dakota. What changed the course of the Souris River? A tributary of the Assiniboine River eroded a channel through the Tiger Hills moraine and “captured” the Souris River and diverted the water into the Assiniboine River abandoning its original channel.</p>

<p>Lake Clementi, a small lake in the Brandon Hills, is alive with bird song any morning in June. But now, with the leaves on the trees, it is a real test of any birder’s ability to identify what those birds are. So how can the Merlin app help? Join the Westman Naturalists for a stroll along Lake Clementi on Sunday, June 12, to try out your skills at bird song identification. If you haven’t used the Merlin app before, this is your chance to give it a try (or just rely on your ears and eyes to tell you what birds are singing). We’ll also show how iNaturalist or Seek can be used to help identify any other plants, insects or animals we encounter.</p>
<p>Depending on time and birds seen, we might investigate other locations in the Brandon Hills. Bring your apps, bird and plant books, binoculars, cameras, etc. Don’t forget to wear appropriate clothing and footwear. A spotting scope may come in handy as there are often birds on the lake.</p>

<p>The Parulidae family (Wood-warblers) are a group of small, fast moving, and often very colourful birds. Over 20 species regularly occur in Manitoba, many of which have distinct male and female plumages that change over the course of the year. This makes them challenging to identify, even for seasoned birders. Christian Artuso will present on the warblers found in Manitoba, and provide tips and tricks for how to identify them.</p>
<p>Many will know Christian for his major contributions to birding and conservation in Manitoba, including coordinating the Manitoba Breeding Bird Atlas. Christian now works as a biologist for the Migratory Bird Conservation Unit of Environment and Climate Change Canada, in Ottawa.</p>

<p><a href="http://lishaberzins.ca/">Dr.&nbsp;Lisha Berzins</a> joins us to discuss aerial insectivores and prairie wetland conservation!</p>
<p>Aerial insectivores (swallows, swifts, nightjars, and flycatchers) are steeply declining in parts of their range and one potential driver of these declines is agricultural intensification. Tree swallows feed primarily on insects that emerge from aquatic habitats and so the loss or drainage of wetlands associated with agricultural intensification may impact tree swallows through their insect food supply. In this talk, Dr.&nbsp;Berzins will use long-term data (&gt;28 years from the St.&nbsp;Denis National Wildlife Area) and field experiments to demonstrate how prairie wetlands influence the ability of tree swallows to breed successfully and produce high-quality young with greater survival prospects, and reduce aquatic insect food available to them. Ultimately, she will discuss whether retaining wetlands in agricultural cropland can offset the negative effect of agricultural intensification on tree swallows, and likely other ecologically similar species.</p>

<p><span class="event-title">Spring Bird ID with Christian Artuso</span>; Hosted by Westman Naturalists</p>
<p>We are all a little rusty at bird identification when spring migration starts. Hopefully, after listening to bird song recordings and studying field guides, we are soon back at our peak skills in naming the new arrivals. But, let’s face it, some birds are just flat out difficult to identify at any time.</p>
<p>The Westman Naturalists are pleased to offer a workshop with Dr.&nbsp;Christian Artuso, (one of our favourite bird experts) where all your burning questions about difficult spring and summer birds will be answered. Want to know if that was a Golden or juvenile Bald Eagle you just saw? House or purple finch? Christian can give you some tips to make identification easier. Is that an Eastern or Western Meadowlark singing on the fence post? Christian can help you differentiate between the two.</p>
<p>To be sure to get your questions answered, please email your questions about bird identification to us at <a href="mailto:westman.naturalists@gmail.com">westman.naturalists@gmail.com</a> by Monday May 3rd. We will forward the questions to Christian, and he will answer them in our Webinar on May 7th.</p>
<p>This workshop will be interactive… a chance to learn from Christian for all birders, expert and beginner. And remember, every question is a good question.</p>

<p><span class="event-title">Wild Turkeys: A Year in the Life</span>; Hosted by Westman Naturalists</p>
<p>Wild turkeys are a common sight in many Ontario landscapes. However, this was not always the case. Turkeys were hunted to extinction in Ontario in the early 1900s and were only reintroduced to the province in the 1980s when wildlife managers traded moose, otter and grouse for turkeys from several US states. Since their reintroduction, Ontario’s wild turkey population has grown rapidly.</p>
<p>Unlike migratory bird species, turkeys stay in Ontario year-round with their behaviour and sociality changing with the seasons. Jenn Baici, a PhD candidate at Trent University, will be discussing the history of wild turkeys in Ontario, how turkey behaviour changes throughout the year, and what this means for her research. She welcomes any and all turkey questions. You can visit <a href="http://www.jennbaici.weebly.com">www.jennbaici.weebly.com</a> to learn more about research projects she has been involved with.</p>

<p><span class="event-title">Cultural Evolution in Bird Song</span>; Hosted by Westman Naturalists</p>
<p>While many groups of birds instinctively ‘know’ and can produce their normal adult vocalizations without training, Passerines are one of the few groups in which juveniles must learn their species-specific song from an adult tutor. This reliance on song learning results in both the development of regional dialects, but also the potential for songs to evolve and change over time within populations. We will discuss the potential of this in relation to our recent work looking at continent-wide shifts in songs among white-throated sparrows.</p>

<p>Join the Nature Conservancy of Canada, Important Bird Areas Manitoba, and Westman Naturalists to learn about Shorebird Conservation in Manitoba.</p>
<p>Shorebirds are a diverse group of migratory birds, a few species of which have some of the longest migration distances in the feathered world. This group of birds is strongly associated with shallow water habitats, such as those found on beaches or shorelines of lakes, shallow wetlands and in flooded fields or grasslands, where they forage for food in the mud and sand. Many follow the “Central Flyway” migratory route that passes through the Prairies.</p>
<p>Learn how International Shorebird Survey volunteers count large flocks of shorebirds, and listen to migratory stories that were tracked through the Motus Wildlife Tracking System!</p>

<p><span class="event-title">Great Canadian Birdathon</span>; Hosted by <a href="https://www.canadahelps.org/en/charities/bird-studies-canada/p2p/birdathon20/">Bird Studies Canada</a></p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.canadahelps.org/en/charities/bird-studies-canada/p2p/birdathon20/">Birdathon</a> is a major fund-raising event for Bird Studies Canada, and a chance to get out for some serious birding - whilst keeping safe of course. Two local groups have had a traditional friendly rivalry, both involve Westman Naturalists.</p>
<p>The “Ageing Turkeys’ will be birding in May, if you are interested in joining or learning more about this group please contact Buzz Crowston at <a href="mailto:vcrowsto@mts.net">vcrowsto@mts.net</a>.</p>
<p>COVID-19 can’t stop Erica and the “Westman Willets”, the Birdathon must go on! This year, our team of enthusiastic birders is once again participating in the Great Canadian Birdathon, raising money in support of avian research and conservation in Canada. Traditionally we would all pile into a car and embark on a grand adventure, travelling all over south western Manitoba, finding as many bird species as possible within a 24 hour period. It is what we birders call a “big day”.</p>
<p>However with the current conditions surrounding COVID-19, our plans have had to change. In 2020, we will hold a different kind of big day, one where we all bird together, while being miles apart. On May 23 we will each bird in our own backyards, and at the end of the day we will come together, virtually, and share our lists. It’ll take some good luck and good birding to beat our travelling total of 130 species, but we’ll give it our best shot!</p>
<p>We hope this years birdathon will remind others that there is nature to be found, and enjoyed, in our own backyards.</p>
<p><strong>Please consider donating to support the important efforts of Bird Studies Canada and the Delta Marsh Bird Observatory.

<p>We will explore one of the best birding areas in the province, Whitewater IBA (Importan Bird Area), visiting several good birding spots around the lake. This is not a “Blitz” but we should see impressive numbers of ducks, geese and swans; plus other species.</p>
<p>Birding at Whitewater involves a fair amount of driving on dirt roads. There will probably also be a little (optional) walking.</p>
<p>Please bring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warm clothes</li>
<li>Suitable footwear (it may be wet)</li>
<li>Binoculars. camera and telescope if you have them</li>
<li>Lunch &amp; snacks, plus coffee if you need it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Car-pooling</strong> We will meet at the SE corner of the Landmark Cinema parking lot at 8:00am (10 minutes before sunrise) to arrive at Whitewater at about 9:00am. We plan to be finished around 2pm, to return to Brandon by about 3pm.</p>
<p><strong>Please email us</strong> if you’d like to attend, with whether you are travelling independently or will meet us in Brandon, and your cell number – so we can contact you if we have to cancel.</p>

<p>Cal Cuthbert will guide us to find all that this great area north of Portage offers. Should be an excellent outing as Cal is an expert birder and guide and knows the area very well.</p>
<p>To car-pool, we will meet at 7:30am in Brandon, <strong>please email the Westman Naturalists to confirm your attendance</strong> and get details regarding the car-pooling location.</p>
<p>On site, we will all meet at about 9:00am at Up The Creek Acres located 8 miles N of Portage on #240 then 2 miles E on #227. After crossing Portage Creek (which is well marked) take the first right (a road that goes south through a wooded area) for about 100m.</p>
<p>We will start with a walkabout on Cal’s property. He has a number of trails both in open “grassland” and riparian areas. His place is also a good place for washroom/coffee break before working our way to the Delta beach ridge. We’ll have a chance at both shorebirds and warblers/sparrows with an assortment of other birds as well.</p>
<p>Cal reminds everyone to bring lots of coffee and huge lunches; together with binoculars, camera and telescope if you have them; and clothing and shoes appropriate for the weather.</p>

<p>This field trip offers a great opportunity for birding and botanizing. And, anyone interested in canoeing or kayaking on the lake may do so. There are cottages on the east side of the lake, and motor boats are strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>If you wish extend your outing past the morning trip, you can stay on the property or explore other local areas such as the Souris River Bend Wildlife Management Area to the west of the lake.</p>
<p>Participants who wish to car pool from Brandon will leave at <strong>8:00 am</strong>, to get to the site between 8:45 and 9:00 am. We will have some spaces for those who prefer not to drive. We will email directions for those who want to travel directly to the site… please register ahead of time.</p>
<p>Naturalists of all skill levels are welcome. There are mowed trails throughout much of the property. However, we may be heading off those trails. Please wear appropriate footwear. Also, poison ivy is widespread, and, yes, there are still a few ticks around. Please plan to bring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Binoculars / camera</li>
<li>Bird book or app</li>
<li>Suitable clothing and footwear</li>
<li>Water, and a lunch.</li>
<li>Insect repellent, sunscreen and a hat.</li>
<li>A walking stick, if need be, however, there terrain is fairly level.</li>
</ul>
<p>To help with our planning, please email the Westman Naturalists to let us know if you plan to attend this outing, together with whether you plan to join us in Brandon or at the site itself.</p>
